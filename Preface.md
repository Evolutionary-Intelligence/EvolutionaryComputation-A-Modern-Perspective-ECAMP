# Preface

![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=Evolutionary-Intelligence.ECAMP-Preface)

As was shown by [Frances H. Arnold](http://fhalab.caltech.edu/), Prof. of California Institute of
Technology, in her Nobel Lecture, "[Responsible for adaptation, optimization, and innovation in
the living world, evolution executes a simple algorithm of diversification and natural selection,
an algorithm that works at all levels of complexity from single protein molecules to whole
ecosystems.](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/10/arnold-lecture.pdf)" Some of **fundamental
principles** (e.g., natural selection) in biological evolution originated from e.g., [Alfred Russel
Wallace](https://tinyurl.com/yvwmuv9b) and [Charles Robert Darwin](https://tinyurl.com/5ywts76r).
These principles, interestingly, *can be* and *have been* employed to solve many (not all)
**complex** computational (e.g., via [evolutionary algorithms](https://tinyurl.com/y57b2r96)),
design (e.g., for [artificial life](https://direct.mit.edu/artl)), modelling, and engineering
(e.g., via [directed evolution](http://fhalab.caltech.edu/)) problems, *often* (though *not
always*) with practically promising or satisfactory performance. In this open book, we will focus
on **computational (rather biological) evolution** for modeling, optimization, learning, and design
from a *modern* (i.e., **probabilistic**) perspective.

Although initially (especially at the beginning stage) so-called **biological evolution-based**
[inspirations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00278-8) (in the form of
[metaphors](https://tinyurl.com/mtmwez9h)) are an *attractive and interesting* point to many
readers, researchers, and practitioners, undoubtedly its **increasingly solid mathematical
foundations, very flexbile algorithmic frameworks, widely available implementation software,
and various application successes (i.e., practical usefulness)**, which are of our great
interest, play cornerstone roles in the growing maturity of the [Evolutionary
Computation/Computing (EC)](https://tinyurl.com/48r89bv2) field, including but not limited to
**Evolutionary Algorithms** ([EAs]()).

Our modest goal for this open book is to provide modern information regarding to EC and some
(*not all*) advanced EC topics, in order to help *perplexed* novices foster the desirable
ability of judging whether or not it is a [good](https://tinyurl.com/msxvdkfb) research
practice on EC, which we think is very crucial for *perplexed* novices in the [explosion of
metaphor-centred methods](https://publications.aston.ac.uk/id/eprint/44574/1/ALIFE_LLCS.pdf)
and the rise of [Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://chat.openai.com/). Our main focus on
EC **is and should be** **general principles and techniques** of designing and analyzing EC
(that is, *whether, when, why, and how to employ EC*) and also their **real-world
applications**, rather than only their biological metaphors (though some metaphors played an
interesting and important role in their early formation stage). In fact, these two key aspects
(i.e., [theories](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-17339-4) and
[practices]()) have been often asked to ourselves and our colleagues. In this sense, we argue
that this open book is one (not necessarily perfect yet worthwhile to explore) answer to these
often-asked questions (in short, *whether, when, why, and how to use and study EC*).

Although we believe there may be more or less [opportunities](https://tinyurl.com/mpdhne4f)
to extend it (such as [Quality-Diversity](https://tinyurl.com/3c5bzumz) and Meta-Evolution)
significantly, most of its **fundamentally** algorithmic structures have been fixed and
unchanged over the past 20 years, to some extents. Therefore, we first adopt a *historical*
perspective to summarize **classical** EC work as the basis of the **modern** perspective,
following the good suggestion (i.e., a **unified** approach) from e.g., [Prof. De Jong]().
For effectiveness and efficiency, ["leveraging (or learning) the statistical and computational
structure of problem"](https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/MAL-070) no matter
*explicitly* or *implicitly* is now one of main research goals when desiging different EA
versions, variants, extensions, and improvements for different kinds of **hard** problems
(such as, [FunSearch](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06924-6),
[Learned (Black-Box) Optimizers](https://icml.cc/virtual/2021/poster/10175),
[OpenAI-ES](https://openai.com/index/evolution-strategies/),
[Population-Based Training (PBT)](https://tinyurl.com/428mrb4f),
[Surrogate Models](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210650211000198),
[NES](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume15/wierstra14a/wierstra14a.pdf),
[CMA-ES](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-467/14-467.pdf),
[EDA/CEM](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume24/22-0628/22-0628.pdf),
to name a few).

First, an important-yet-difficult research question to be answered is the underlying assumptions
behind [EAs](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14544). Since the **black-box** (or more
generally, **complex**) nature of hard (e.g., NP-hard) problems tackled **approximately** by EAs,
it is very difficult, if not impossible, to mathematically quantitize these (typically *implicit*)
assumptions behind different EAs, and also their working principles (e.g., **from first
principles**). In this open book, we will first discuss the hard-to-clarify relationships between
underlying assumptions and black-box applications. Note that in practice, the level of black-boxes
vary on different classes of complex problems.

Up to now, there have been several *wonderful* books devoted to EC, such as [[Eiben&Smith, 2015]](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-44874-8), [[De Jong, 2006]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/book/6267245), [[Fogel, 2006]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/book/5237910)/[[Fogel, 1998]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/book/5263042), [[Mitchell, 1998]](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4675/An-Introduction-to-Genetic-Algorithms), [[Back, 1996]](https://academic.oup.com/book/40791), [[Koza, 1990]](http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/90/1314/CS-TR-90-1314.pdf), to name a few. Furthermore, there have been a number of *well-written* review/survey/perspective papers for EC or one particular class of EAs: e.g., [[Miikkulainen&Forrest, 2021, Nature MI]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00278-8), [[Lehman et al., 2020, ALJ]](https://direct.mit.edu/artl/article/26/2/274/93255/The-Surprising-Creativity-of-Digital-Evolution-A), [[Eiben&Smith, 2015, Nature]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14544), [[Schoenauer, 2015]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-9014-7_28), [[De Jong&Fogel&Schwefel, 1997]](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781482268713-13/history-evolutionary-computation), [[Koza, 1994]](), [[Forrest, 1993, Science]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.8346439), just to name a few. Undoubtedly, all of these above works provide multiple *good* starting points to learn EAs or one particular algorithm class for practice and to enter the EC research community.

With the renaissance of [neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608014002135) (now also called [deep learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539)) for AI/ML, the interesting interactions between **learning and evolution** (e.g., [[Hinton&Nowlan, 1987]](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/baldwin.pdf), [[Maynard Smith, 1987, Nature]](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/maynardsmith.pdf)) are worthwhile to be further investigated.
